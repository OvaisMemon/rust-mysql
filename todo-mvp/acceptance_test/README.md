# Acceptance Test

This is a work in progress.

## To run

Please see the [README.md][RubyReadme] in the `ruby` directory for how to run
the tests.

## Multiple implementations

Although tangential to the project itself, one of the ideas we've had is that
the acceptance tests can also be implemented in multiple languages. 

This is less fun than I thought it would be. The reference implementation at
present is the one written in Ruby, found in the `ruby` directory.
